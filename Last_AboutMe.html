        <p>Hi! My name is Bibek Das. I'm fueled only by passion and will. My goal is to pursue Computer Science. I wish to do so because I'm interested in how computers and work and I enjoy programming itself . I hope to make programs in the future that greatly enhance or help other people do tasks; Or in short simplify simple tasks.</p>
        <br>
        <p>The first langauge I learned was C. Most programming languages are designed around C. So I was able to gain a basic understanding of programming and all the basic stuff like variables, loops, conditionals, if statements, booleans, and etc. To add on, I made a really basic calculator app on C, that does all the basic functions: Add, Subtract, Multiply, and Divide. Unfortunately, you can't add GUI to C, so I wasn't able to further advance the self-induced project. </p>
        <br>
        <p>I have pretty good leadership skills. I'm able to assign people the roles they can do in big projects, part of the reason why I'm pretty successful in long term projects that have group invovlement. To back this statement up, I was the captain of the track team in middle school.</p>
