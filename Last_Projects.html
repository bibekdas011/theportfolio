      <p class="card-text">The process for making this app wasn’t that hard. To determine what changes to make in each version, we just ranted on everything wrong on the app. We also tried to make the app more interesting which is also how we determined the versions. For example, we increased the speed so that way the PirateShip moves faster. This makes the app more responsive and fun to play. To add on, some functions wouldn’t work like the screens. The screens would work for the ai companion app. If you do the screens for the apk file, the app doesn’t go that screen. If the apk file was able to go to the different screens, then we had a starting screen and an instruction screen. Overall, the process of making our app wasn’t that hard. All we had to do was make the app more interesting and fun to play to dictate the versions.</p>

      <!--Text-->
        <p class="card-text">In this project, we had to research different documents regarding the Stuxnet attacks, select a debate position on whether or not it was justified, and create a slide representing our position.<strong>Our creative process:</strong> began as us discussing whether or not it was actually justified in a conversation format. Afterwards, we put our ideas into a list and then converted them into a Google Slide. The pertinent questions we were asked were: "Was Stuxnet Justified?" and "Should Cyber Warfare be internationally banned similar to chemical warfare". The position we took on was: Pro, Cyberware shouldn't banned and Stuxnet was justifiable</p>

     <p class="card-text"><strong>Our Creative Process:</strong> It initially began as us trying to brainstorming random ideas and taking knowledge of other games and see how we could implement that to our own game. We came up with some good ideas, and the fact that both of us played games in our free time, helped us come up with ideas for our game. We found that by making the game more sophisticated throughout the  way was an easy way  to tackle the Version Control. After playing games like Fruit Ninja and knowledge of arcade games, we came up with our game. The knowledge we had on games was very helpful to the development of our game.</p>

        <p class="card-text">For this project, we had to create a plan of action that revolved around the Cybersecurity Lifecycle, make a incident response form, and research commercial and open source incident response software. We included a discussion of our plan of action, steps we took to secure the system, and a discussion of our completed incident response form. Additionally, we demonstrated understanding of Cybersecurity Lifecycle and how to implement it.</p>

          <p class="card-text">For this project, we were given start java code to create an interactive seating chart. We had to implement one of the abstract classes and demonstrated mastery of Github worflow as the whole class pushed to a single repository compiling into one final file. Whenever you click on a student, the student will perform an animation as well as play a sound file introducing the student too. Additionally, we had to implement a group method per table group, a method that was applicable to all students and added to the user functionality of the seating chart.</p>
